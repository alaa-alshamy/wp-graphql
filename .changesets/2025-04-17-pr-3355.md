# Description

This PR focuses on updating descriptions for Enum types to be more clear. 

## New Features: 

- Allow enum value descriptions to be defined as a callable (see: https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/3355/files#diff-ce95ce616e43f99d34ed9d1d3b527ca28dfce56b10ab9e4946dccf8bfd741653R61-R71)
- $type_name is now passed to the \`graphql_enum_values\` filter(s) (see: https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/pull/3355/files#diff-ce95ce616e43f99d34ed9d1d3b527ca28dfce56b10ab9e4946dccf8bfd741653R79-R97)
