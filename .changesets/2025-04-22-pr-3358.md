## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

This PR updates the Composer deps to their latest (semver) compatible versions.

Of note:
- \`webonyx/graphql-php\` v15.20.0 : https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php/releases/tag/v15.20.0
- \`slevomat/coding-standards\` deprecated \`SlevomatCodingStandard.TypeHints.UnionTypeHintFormat\` which we weren't explicitly using in favor of \`SlevomatCodingStandard.TypeHints.DNFTypeHintFormat\` which we're already implicitly including, so the former is now excluded. Ref: https://github.com/slevomat/coding-standard/blob/34325312cbd9465a222564597e9f56e42750939c/SlevomatCodingStandard/Sniffs/TypeHints/UnionTypeHintFormatSniff.php#L74
