## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.
This PR updates the Composer deps to their latest (semver) compatible versions.
Of note:
- \\`webonyx/graphql-php\\` v15.20.0 : https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php/releases/tag/v15.20.0
- \\`slevomat/coding-standards\\` deprecated \\`SlevomatCodingStandard.TypeHints.UnionTypeHintFormat\\` which we werentexplicitlyusinginfavorofwhichwere already implicitly including, so the former is now excluded.
