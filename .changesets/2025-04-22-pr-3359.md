## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.
This PR updates our Codeception workflow to trigger more often.
More specifically it now:
- Triggers on changes to Composer dependencies.
- Triggers on changes to any test files
- _Only_ triggers on changes to \\`.github/workflows/testing-integration.yml\\` and not on all workflow changes.
## Any other comments?
To be pedantic, you could merge this to ensure #3358 is tested
