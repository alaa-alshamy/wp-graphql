## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.
This PR implements a reusable PHPStan array shape for the \\`AdminNotices\\` class, removing all unintentional uses for \\`mixed\\`. (\\`mixed\\` is still used for the filter, so it can be validated).
As a result of this change, PHPStan caught (and this fixes) the incorrect validation of the filtered notice.
_There are no breaking changes in this PR_.
## Any other comments?
LLMs + IDEs + Extenders all really like shaped arrays. This is the first PR of hopefully many getting rid of the \\`mixed\\` type however possible.
