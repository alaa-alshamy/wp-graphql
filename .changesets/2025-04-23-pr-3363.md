## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

This PR cleans up the existing WPGraphQL Models in the following ways:
- Fixes the model \`@property\` tags and sorts them.
- Sorts the model \`fields\` (cosmetic, to make the diff's easier to read now and in the future)
- Fixes individual model resolvers, either where the current return type could throw an error, or where they were "aliases" of other fields.
- Replaced internal references to "alias fields" with their source of truth.
- Fixes _all references_ to model fields (exposed now that the types were fixed and better enforced).

As a result, we're also able to begin enforcing traversable types on new code via PHPStan.

Additional benefits:
- Better types mean better usage with llms
- Cleanup now paves the way for more important changes (breaking or nonbreaking) with smaller diffs.
