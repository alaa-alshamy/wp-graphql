## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

This PR fixes the use of \`mixed\` in iterable types inside the \`Admin\Extensions\` and \`Admin\AdminNotices\` class. The only remaining uses of mixed in that class are intentional: i.e. when we're trying to validate if a filtered list of extensions has the necessary data.

Additionally, native types have been implemented in all places in those classes where to do so would not cause any breakings.

There are _no_ breaking or user-facing changes in this PR.
