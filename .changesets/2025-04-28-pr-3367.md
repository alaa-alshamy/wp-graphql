## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

This PR:

- Inlines all (backwards-compatible) PHPDoc types into their native PHP types
- Replaces the use of \`mixed\` with the specific array shape (_where possible_)
- Adds type-narrowing to \`WPGraphQL::get_allowed_post_types()\` and \`::get_allowed_taxonomies()\`, so the correct traversable type of the array is hinted correctly.

References to these functions have been cleaned up accordingly (usually just by removing a \`/** @var {...} */\` typehint.

There are _no_ breaking changes in this PR.


## Does this close any currently open issues?



## Any other comments?
