title: "fix: don't initialize  twice in class constructor"

## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

This PR fixes a bug in the \`Request::__construct()\` method, where the \`->app_context\` was previously initialized twice.

Now it's only initialized once, while the \`$type_registry\` continues to be injected onto the AppContext class at the same point of the lifecycle.


## Does this close any currently open issues?



## Any other comments?
