## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

This PR improves the type hinting inside \`WPEnumType\` to use explicit array shapes instead of \`mixed\` whenever possible, all the way through to the \`register_graphql_enum_type()\` config array.

Additionally, some complexity was removed via early returns, and the \`PostStatusEnum\` was refactored to fix a missing description.

## Does this close any currently open issues?



Nope

## Any other comments?

As part of #3354, we can update values to support a callable too, but it will take care to preserve the filters.
