## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

This PR improves the type safety across the codebase by reducing the use of \`mixed\` and addressing the resulting PHPStan errors.

Additionally, the SchemaConfig syntax was updated to use the [\`::create()\` syntax https://webonyx.github.io/graphql-php/schema-definition/#using-config-class], and wrapped in callable for an ostensible perf improvement.
