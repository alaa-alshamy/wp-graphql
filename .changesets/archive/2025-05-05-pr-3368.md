## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.


This PR audits and fixes the PHPDoc types in the \`WPGraphQL\`, \`WPGraphQL\Server\`, \`WPGraphQL\Utils\` namespaces, in the following ways:

- Replace use of \`mixed\` with a more specific type whenever possible.
   **Note:** Due to cross-class dependencies, numerous uses of \`mixed\` were left as is, specifically regarding the \`Router\` class.
- Used PHPStan conditional return types to narrow types when helpful.
- Fixed various small bugs and type errors in those and other classes as a result of the above changes.

There are _no breaking changing_ in this PR. I've left a comment on the (limited) code-related changes.

## Does this close any currently open issues?



## Any other comments?



This is a "first pass" because I really dont understand the \`Router\` class, and its reuse of the same parameters at different points in the lifecycle. Will take a second pass (in a follow up PR) ~once I get clarity from @jasonbahl~ ✔️
